PyQt theme playground(qtsasstheme)

I'm currently busy by other project and i start thinking that Qt is not for aesthetic software. But hopefully someone finds this useful. 

## Included

## TODO list
* fix the bug that some of the svg icons not resized by the font resizing
* support customized widgets and qml widget as qquickwidget
* solve the choppy svg icon in the customized widgets
* set margin and padding dynamically based on font size
* support PySide as well
